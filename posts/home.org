*Howdy!* I am many things, the most important of which are father, son and husband. But I am also a data scientist employed in healthcare, a former physics student, a Chess player, and a technology enthusiast. My interests are pretty vast, ranging from motorcycling to Star Wars, and I intend to use this blog to write about them. Expect to find a lot of Chess and Emacs-related stuff, with a sprinkling of everything else.

About my moniker: When I first joined Mastodon, my then four-year-old daughter was obsessed with the show Jurassic Park: Camp Cretaceous. The moniker is a reference to a dinosaur in that show, a name she lovingly picked for me.
